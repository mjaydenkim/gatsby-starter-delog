metaDescription: SOUR by Olivia Rodrigo -- Album Review
---

Damn, I did not expect this to be as good as it was.
<br/>

Olivia Rodrigo is an actress and singer, best known for her key roles on critically panned Disney Channel series *Bizaardvark* (starring none other than Jake Paul himself) and Disney+ series *High School Musical: The Musical: The Series*, or *High School Musical: Inception Edition*. However, she broke through in the music scene unexpectedly successfully in January, releasing the first bona fide pop hit of the year, "drivers license". It broke Spotify's record for most daily streams for a non-holiday song twice (damn you, Mariah Carey, you and your awesome Christmas music), and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for eight full weeks -- an accomplishment for any artist's new track, let alone a debut single. 
<br/>

She also had a new album ready incredibly fast -- only four months after "drivers license", Rodrigo released *SOUR*, her debut solo album, and it's surprisingly good! It's nothing mindblowing, but for an artist like Rodrigo to break through with such a quality album is impressive, to say the least. I came into *SOUR* with somewhat low expectations, but Rodrigo managed to surpass them with flying colors, and I'm excited to see whatever she decides to do next musically.
<br/>

*SOUR* introduces itself with the track "brutal", a bit of a red herring in terms of the album's sound and lyrical direction. Kicking off with a short orchestral introduction before launching into roaring guitar riffs, the song sees Rodrigo singing about self-hatred, loneliness, and teenage disillusionment. I immediately expected the album to continue in this direction lyrically, if not instrumentally, but it largely doesn't -- the majority of the album centers around a very specific topic, that topic being spite over a break-up and watching an ex-partner "move on" without you. Normally, such repetition of a singular topic on an album like *SOUR* would irk me to no end, but it's approached from many different angles stylistically and thematically throughout the project, and Rodrigo comes from an unusually genuine place in her writing and vocal delivery that makes the record's themes come off surprisingly successfully. 
<br/>

This topic is first broached on the album's second cut, "traitor", where Rodrigo tells an intricate story of betrayal by a former partner behind atmospheric synths, early-Taylor-Swift-esque guitars, and huge background vocals, and the narrative is continued throughout the album. For example, "1 step forward, 3 steps back" details an abusive, fair-weather relationship, and "good 4 u", the most instrumentally mismatching (and perhaps the most generic) track of the bunch, focuses on Rodrigo's relationship-fueled turmoil, and the way her partner moved on from her, unaffected by their split. These stories are told all throughout the album, and, unlike many other pop projects, are never balanced out with any love songs. Billboard, in an interview with Rodrigo, writes that she initially attempted to neutralize the album's lyrically harsher moments with some "sweeter-skewing love songs", but that it didn't feel geniune to do so considering her emotional turbulence during the album's writing period.
<br/>

However, the album isn't all one-note: the aforementioned "brutal" is an example of this, as are the tracks "jealousy, jealousy" (which deals with the detrimental effects of comparing yourself to others, especially on social media), and the album's closer, "hope ur ok", the most lyrically interesting track of the bunch by far. On this song, Rodrigo reminisces about old elementary and middle school friends who she had fallen out of touch with, and on an album of heartbreak and spite, it's easily the most heartwarming song of the bunch, despite the track being just as melancholic as it is touching.
<br/>

The production on this album is also great, even if it's nothing surprising. Dan Nigro, the album's executive producer, worked with artists including Conan Gray, Caroline Polachek, and Carly Rae Jepsen in the past, and he doesn't disappoint on *SOUR*. The album's soft acoustic and piano ballads, its groovy sing-alongs, and everything in between are all handled with ease on this album, and the small production details are quite nice when they occasionally show up (example: "drivers license"'s short decrescendos that sound vaguely like a car's motor revving down). 

To conclude, *SOUR* is, really, a surprisingly great LP. It may feel a little bit one-trick and runs the risk of pigeonholing Rodrigo into the themes of break-up and bitterness she emphasized on this album, and Rodrigo wears her influence on her sleeve very obviously, but I found this project unexpectedly listenable and even enjoyable, with high-quality production, songwriting, and vocals. For someone whose claim to fame is Jake Paul's Disney Channel show, she might as well have won the lottery.
