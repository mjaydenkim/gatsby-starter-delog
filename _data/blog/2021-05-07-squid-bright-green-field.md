DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE DATE TO BE ACTUALLY ACCURATE LOL
<br/>

Squid is a five-member British post-punk band, based in Brighton, England. Formed in university, the band released their debut EP on the boundary-pushing Speedy Wunderground, and in just a few years, the band gained a sizeable following within the so-called [Windmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windmill,_Brixton) scene (other prominent Windmill alumnni are Black Country, New Road and black midi). The band stayed closely connected to Speedy, although they signed to Warp Records preceding the release of the album -- *Bright Green Field* was produced and mixed by Dan Carey, the label's co-founder. Written in a windowless barn in vocalist and drummer Ollie Judge's hometown and recorded in Carey's fabled basement studio over just three weeks, *Bright Green Field* is one of the most chaotic, unnerving, and groovy albums of the year, and is poised to be one of its best. For a band that once described their music as “the Coronation Street theme tune played on flutes by angry children,” this is quite a damn record. 
<br/>

Even before the release of *Bright Green Field*, the album had already won me over -- each one of the three pre-release singles blew me away. A great example is the album's lead single, "Narrator", a perfect illustration of Squid's writing and instrumental prowess. An eight-and-a-half-minute behemoth of a song, "Narrator" features Judge's partially-screamed, yelpy vocals, which provide a foil to featured vocalist Martha Syke Murphy's understated spoken word. The song's first leg also sports a consistent, funky, and incredibly catchy groove. However, just over halfway into the track, the instrumental crescendos and Ollie's vocals quickly devolve into manic, tuneless screaming. The song builds to a fierce climax behind Murphy's tortured shrieks until the track fades into a dystopian, dark ambient drone, cutting off abruptly. 
<br/>

As was foreshadowed by "Narrator", *Bright Green Field* deals heavily in themes of dystopia. In a press release, the band wrote, “Previous [Squid] releases were playful and concerned with characters, whereas this album is darker and more concerned with place - the emotional depth of the music has deepened.” The tone of a dystopian British cityscape is set all over the album -- the opener "G.S.K.", a modern take on the J.G. Ballard novel *Concrete Island*, sees Squid contrast the real and the synthetic ("Bright neon bikes on the hillside / Mosquito nets, they cover the buildings"). "Global Groove", the album's penultimate track, addresses numbing yourself to worldly strifes and the [glorification of violence for profit in the news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cADiZii4X8s) (“Watch your favorite war on TV/Just before you go to sleep/And then your favorite sitcom/Watch the tears roll down your cheek"). 
<br/>

Much like the best dystopian novels, this album is also head-spinningly unpredictable. The seven-minute track "Boy Racers" kicks off with a relatively normal (and mostly unremarkable) Squid groove before devolving into a minutes-long, atmospheric drone section that lasts for the song's entire second half. Vocal snippets, intense shots of bass, and mangled synths make the listener feel like they’re floating in another dimension, or surveying the landscape in an apocalyptic movie, and it saves "Boy Racers" from being one of the more uninteresting cuts on *Bright Green Field*. The album also has its fair share of jukes -- "Documentary Filmmaker" starts off relatively quiet and understated for two minutes. When Ollie's manic vocals build with the song's intensity, the listener begins to expect a grand climax, but the opposite happens, Ollie's repeated vocals fading out with the instruments at the end of the track. 
<br/>

However, peel back the dystopian themes and you'll find an incredibly groovy and even fun dance-punk LP. The previously mentioned "G.S.K." has a driving dance-punk beat that makes it an absolute earworm, and "Paddling" (especially its chorus) is instrumentally bright and dance-able. There is also a heavy jazz influence on this LP -- take the brass interlude "The Flyover" as an example, or the aforementioned "Global Groove". 
<br/>

Another integral part of this album (and perhaps its most controversial) is Judge's vocal delivery. All over this album, Judge speaks, sings, and screams in an aggressive, yelpy voice that has made Squid's music quite polarizing -- some admire his panicked singing, but some find it obnoxious. Personally, I love it -- it took time for the vocals to grow on me, but his delivery fits the band and its instrumentals perfectly, especially on tracks like "Narrator", "Pamphlets", and the crescendo on "Documentary Filmmaker". If I'm being honest, I wish he had employed this more aggressive voice more often throughout the album -- songs like "G.S.K." and "2010" could have benefitted. 
<br/>

My main complaint about *Bright Green Field* is that some tracks simply don't hit as hard as they could. The first half of "Boy Racers", for example, is mostly forgettable, and if it weren't for the ambient second half, it might have lost my interest completely. I also found the song "2010" less 'sticky' than it could have been, but I can clearly see it growing on me in just another listen or two. Other than that, though, I have little to no complaints about this project, and the creativity, quality, and willingness to experiment on nearly every track here means that even the less memorable tracks are still great, and the more memorable ones blew me out of my seat. 
<br/>

This album is an incredibly strong debut for Squid -- unlike many of their contemporaries, *Bright Green Field* is an incredibly varied album, but one with a defined and refined sound. Clear instrumental and writing talent are on display on this LP, but it's just as clear that Squid still has enough room to take their sound and experimentation to another level on future projects. This band is something special, and if I had to guesss, the 2020s will be Squid's decade.
