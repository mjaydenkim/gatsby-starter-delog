metaDescription: Bright Green Field by Squid -- Album Review
---

Squid is a five-member British post-punk band, based in Brighton, England. Formed in university, the band released their debut EP on boundary-pushing label Speedy Wunderground, and in just a few years, they gained a sizeable following within the so-called [Windmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windmill,_Brixton) scene (prominent Windmill alumni include Black Country, New Road, Shame and black midi, among others). The band stayed closely connected to Speedy, although they signed to Warp Records preceding the release of the album -- *Bright Green Field* was produced and mixed by Dan Carey, the label's co-founder. Written in a windowless barn in vocalist and drummer Ollie Judge's hometown and recorded in Carey's fabled basement studio over just three weeks, *Bright Green Field* is one of the most chaotic, unnerving, and groovy albums of the year, and is poised to be one of its best. For a band that once described their music as “the Coronation Street theme tune played on flutes by angry children,” this is quite a damn record. 
<br/>

Thanks to a trio of exceptional singles, *Bright Green Field* won me over even before its release. A great example is the album's lead single, "Narrator", a perfect illustration of Squid's writing and instrumental prowess. An eight-and-a-half-minute behemoth of a song, "Narrator" features Judge's partially-screamed, yelpy vocals, which provide a foil to featured vocalist Martha Syke Murphy's understated spoken word. The song's first leg also sports a consistent, funky, and incredibly catchy groove. However, just over halfway into the track, the instrumental crescendos and Ollie's vocals quickly devolve into manic, tuneless screaming. The song builds to a fierce climax behind Murphy's tortured shrieks until the track fades into a dystopian, dark ambient drone, cutting off abruptly. 
<br/>

As was foreshadowed by "Narrator", *Bright Green Field* deals heavily in themes of dystopia. In a press release, the band wrote, “Previous [Squid] releases were playful and concerned with characters, whereas this album is darker and more concerned with place - the emotional depth of the music has deepened.” The setting of a dystopian British cityscape is set all over the album -- the opener "G.S.K.", a modern take on the J.G. Ballard novel *Concrete Island*, sees Squid contrast the real and the synthetic ("Bright neon bikes on the hillside / Mosquito nets, they cover the buildings"). "Global Groove", the album's penultimate track, addresses numbing oneself to worldly strifes and the [glorification of violence for profit in the news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cADiZii4X8s) (“Watch your favorite war on TV / Just before you go to sleep / And then your favorite sitcom / Watch the tears roll down your cheek"). 
<br/>

Much like the best dystopian novels, this album is also head-spinningly unpredictable. The seven-minute "Boy Racers" kicks off with a relatively normal (and mostly unremarkable) Squid groove before abruptly cutting into a minutes-long, atmospheric drone section that lasts for the song's entire second half. Vocal snippets, intense shots of bass, and mangled synths make the listener feel like they’re floating in another dimension, or surveying the landscape in an apocalyptic movie. The album also has its fair share of jukes -- when Ollie's manic vocals build with the instrumental's intensity on "Documentary Filmmaker", the listener begins to expect a grand climax, but the opposite happens, the track decrescendoing into an ambient piece for its last minute. 
<br/>

However, peel back the dystopian themes and you'll find an incredibly groovy and even fun dance-punk LP. The previously mentioned "G.S.K." has a driving dance-punk beat that makes it an absolute earworm, and "Paddling" (especially its chorus) is instrumentally bright and dance-able. There is also a heavy jazz influence on this LP -- take the brass interlude "The Flyover" as an example, or the aforementioned "Global Groove". 
<br/>

Another integral part of this album is Ollie Judge -- both for his exceptional drumming (which is not controversial) and his vocals (which are). All over this album, he speaks, sings, and screams in an aggressive, yelpy voice that has made Squid's music quite polarizing. Personally, though, I love it. His delivery complements *Bright Green Field* perfectly, especially on tracks like "Narrator", "Pamphlets", and "Documentary Filmmaker". If I'm being honest, I wish he had employed it more often -- songs like "G.S.K." and "2010" could have benefitted. 
<br/>

My main complaint about *Bright Green Field* is that some tracks simply don't hit as hard as they could. The first half of "Boy Racers", for example, is mostly forgettable, and if it weren't for the second half, it might have lost my interest completely. I also found the song "2010" less 'sticky' than it could have been, but I can  see it growing on me in just another listen or two. Other than that, though, I have little to no complaints about this project, and the band's creativity, quality, and willingness to experiment means that even the less memorable tracks are still great (and that the best ones blew me out of my seat).
<br/>

*Bright Green Field* is an extremely strong starting point for Squid -- unlike many of their contemporaries' debut projects, it's an incredibly varied album, but still one with a defined and refined sound. Clear instrumental and writing talent are on display on this LP, but it's just as obvious that Squid has more than enough room to take their sound and experimentation to another level on future projects. This band is something special, and if I had to guess, the 2020s will be Squid's decade. Squidcoin to the moon!
