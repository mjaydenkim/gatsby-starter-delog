DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE DATE TO BE ACTUALLY ACCURATE LOL
<br/>

Squid is a five-member British post-punk band, based in Brighton, England. Formed in university, the band released their debut EP on cult indie label Speedy Wunderground. In just a few years, the band gained a sizeable following within the so-called [Windmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windmill,_Brixton) scene (other prominent Windmill alumnni are Black Country, New Road and black midi. The band stayed closely connected to Speedy, although they signed to Warp Records preceding the release of the album -- *Bright Green Field* is produced by Dan Carey, the label's co-founder. Written in a windowless barn in vocalist Ollie Judge's hometown and recorded in Carey's fabled basement studio over just three weeks, *Bright Green Field* is... For a band that once described their music as “The Coronation Street theme tune played on flutes by angry children,” this is quite a damn record. 
<br/>

Even before the release of *Bright Green Field*, the album had already won me over -- each one of the three pre-release singles blew me away. A great example is the album's lead single, "Narrator" -- it's a perfect illustration of Squid's writing and instrumental prowess. An eight-and-a-half-minute behemoth of a song, "Narrator" features Ollie's partially-screamed, yelpy vocals, which provide a foil to featured vocalist Martha Syke Murphy's understated spoken word. The song's first leg also features a consistent, funky groove that makes the track incredibly catchy. However, just over halfway into the track, the instrumental crescendos and Ollie's vocals quickly devolve into manic, tuneless screaming. The song builds to a fierce climax behind Murphy's tortured shrieks until the track closes with a dystopian, dark ambient drone, cutting off abruptly.

As was foreshadowed by "Narrator", *Bright Green Field* deals heavily in themes of dystopia -- the band described the album as creating "a kind of dystopian British cityscape.” In a press release, the band wrote, “Previous [Squid] releases were playful and concerned with characters, whereas this album is darker and more concerned with place - the emotional depth of the music has deepened.” Examples of this are littered all over the album -- "G.S.K.", a modern (and quite funky) take on the J.G. Ballard novel *Concrete Island*, pairs rich strings and modulated synths as Squid contrasts the real and the synthetic ("Bright neon bikes on the hillside / Mosquito nets, they cover the buildings"). "Global Groove", the album's penultimate track, addresses numbing yourself to worldly strifes and the [glorification of violence for profit in the news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cADiZii4X8s) (“Watch your favorite war on TV/Just before you go to sleep/And then your favorite sitcom/Watch the tears roll down your cheek"). **(finish this paragraph once you actually listen to daaa album)**

Much like the best dystopian novels, this album is also head-spinningly unpredictable. The seven-minute track "Boy Racers" kicks off with a relatively normal Squid groove before devolving into a minutes-long, atmospheric drone section that lasts for the song's entire second half. The album also has its fair share of jukes -- "Documentary Filmmaker" starts off relatively quiet and understated for two minutes until Ollie's manic vocals build with the song's intensity and tempo. Just when the listener expects a grand climax, however, the song decrescendos again, Ollie's repeated vocals fading out with the instruments at the end of the track.
