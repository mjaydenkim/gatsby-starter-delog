DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE DATE TO BE ACTUALLY ACCURATE LOL
<br/>

Squid is a five-member British post-punk band, based in Brighton, England. Formed in university, the band released their debut EP on cult indie label Speedy Wunderground, and the band quickly gained a sizeable following within the so-called Windmill scene, among the likes of Black Country, New Road, black midi, and Shame. The band stayed closely connected to Speedy, although they signed to Warp Records preceding the release of the album--*Bright Green Field* is produced by Dan Carey, the label's co-founder. Written in a windowless barn in vocalist Ollie Judge's hometown and recorded in Dan Carey's fabled basement studio over just three weeks, *Bright Green Field* is... For a band that once described themselves as “The Coronation Street theme tune played on flutes by angry children,” this is quite a damn record.

Even before the release of *Bright Green Field*, the album had already won me over--each one of the three pre-release singles blew me away. Despite the majority of singles running over 8 minutes, these tracks captured my attention and never let go. The lead single, "Narrator", is a perfect illustration of Squid's writing and instrumental prowess. An eight-and-a-half-minute behemoth of a song, "Narrator" starts off with Ollie's partially-screamed, yelpy vocals contrasting with Martha Syke Murphy's understated spoken word and a consistent, funky groove that makes the song instantly catchy. Roughly halfway through the track, however, the instrumental starts to get louder and more chaotic as Ollie's vocals quickly devolve into manic, tuneless screaming, and the instrumental builds to a climax behind Murphy's tortured shrieks until the track closes with a dystopian, dark ambient drone that cuts off abruptly.

As was foreshadowed by "Narrator", *Bright Green Field* deals heavily in themes of dystopia. As the band explained in a press release, “Previous [Squid] releases were playful and concerned with characters, whereas this album is darker and more concerned with place - the emotional depth of the music has deepened.” “This album has created an imaginary cityscape. A kind of dystopian British cityscape.” For example, "G.S.K.", a modern take on a J.G. Ballard novel, pairs rich strings and modulated synths as Squid contrasts the real and the synthetic ("As the sun sets on the GlaxoKline / Well, that's the only way I can tell the time"), and "Global Groove" addresses modern dystopia and numbing yourself to worldly strifes (“Watch your favorite war on TV/Just before you go to sleep/And then your favorite sitcom/Watch the tears roll down your cheek").
